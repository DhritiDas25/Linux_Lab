Great! Let’s now explore intermediate and advanced terminal commands, including user management, permissions, and sudo commands. These are especially useful for Linux/macOS system administration or development environments.

# 1.`sudo` – Run Commands as Administrator

`sudo` (SuperUser DO) allows you to run commands with root privileges.

```bash
sudo command
```

Example:

```bash
sudo apt update   # run package update as admin
sudo reboot       # Reboot system
```

You'll usually be prompted to enter your password.

# 2. User Management(Linux/macOS only)
## ```adduser```: Creates a new user

```bash
sudo adduser newusername
```
You’ll be prompted to set a password and user info.

## ```passwd```: Change User Password
```bash
sudo passwd username
```
## ```usermod```– Modify User Account

Add a user to the group:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG groupname username
```
Example:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo alice     # Give 'alice' sudo access
```
## ```deluser```: Delete a user
```bash
sudo deluser username
```
To remove the user's home directory:
```bash
sudo deluser --remove-home username
```
# 3. File Permissions with ```chmod``` and ```chown```
## ```chmod``` – Change File Permissions

Basic syntax:
```bash
chmod [permissions] file
```
Common Usage:
```bash
chmod 755 script.sh     # Owner: read/write/execute; others: read/execute
chmod +x file.sh        # Add execute permission
chmod -x file.sh        # Remove execute permission
```
## What Do Numbers Mean?

| Number | Permission             |
| ------ | ---------------------- |
| 7      | read + write + execute |
| 6      | read + write           |
| 5      | read + execute         |
| 4      | read only              |
| 0      | no permission          |

Example:
```bash
chmod 644 file.txt
Owner: read/write, Group: read, Others: read
```
## ```chown```: Change File Owner
```bash
sudo chown user:group file
```
Example:
```bash
sudo chown alice:alice myfile.txt
```
# 4. Disk Usage & System Info
## ```df``` – Disk Space Usage
```bash
df -h
```
Shows mounted partitions with human-readable sizes.

## ```du``` – Directory Size
```bash
du -sh folder_name
```
## ```top```: Live System Process
```bash
top
```
Press ```q``` to quit.

Alternative: ```htop``` (better UI, needs to be installed)

# 5. Networking Commands
## ```ping```: Check Network Connectivity
```bash
ping google.com
```
Press ```CTRL + C``` to stop.

## ifcofig or ip a: Show IP Address or Network Info

```bash
ip a
```
```bash
ifconfig # May require sudo or installation
```
## ```netstat```: Show Active Network Connections

```bash
netstat -tuln
```
Or use:
```bash
ss -tuln # Faster alternative
```

# 6. Package Management
## For Ubuntu/Debian (APT):
```bash
sudo apt update            # Refresh package list
sudo apt upgrade           # Upgrade installed packages
sudo apt install git       # Install a package
sudo apt remove git        # Uninstall a package
```
## For macOS (Homebrew):
```
brew install git
```
# 7. Process Management
## ```ps```: Show running process
```bash
ps aux
```
## ```kill```: Kill a process
```bash

```
Example:
```bash
kill 12345
```

Force kill:

sudo shutdown -r now  #Immediate Reboot
```
